Misc information about TTU ECE classes to use as a guide. Some folders have more info than others. There are also duplicate classes in each degree folder with different information, so look at both for any one class. These degrees can be brutal if you do not like the subject. The goal is you can look at this material and determine if it you want to learn more or if this does not suit you.

## Overall
1. Your academic advisor will be your BEST resource when figuring out your degree plan. The best way to use this resource is by walking in with a full academic plan and asking them what they think. They will also be THE person to ask if you want to do something unusual (taking unique electives, grad courses during undergrad, requesting an additional class section if all others are full, etc). Start as early as possible on this. 
2. Both degrees are heavily project based with 2-4 exams total per class (if they have exams).
3. Internships make you golden in any industry. Typically, companies will hire Juniors and Seniors unless you have ridiculously good technical skills earlier. Put your projects from classes in your resume. Companies especially love group projects.

## Electrical Engineering
1. Most of this degree is building a foundation of general EE knowledge until you get to your electives. Electives are where you can zero in on what you enjoy, but you need the foundational stuff to figure that out. The degree plan listed in the EE folder focused on embedded systems and image/signal processing, but there are plenty of other options. TTU EE is really, really top notch in power systems (look into their pulse power labs and research assistant opportunities).
2. 2/3rds hardware. 1/3rd software. Hardware ranges from using arduinos + different sensors/modules to soldering your designed circuit piece by piece. Software languages are typically MatLab, C/C++ and variants, Assembly, Verilog, and maybe some python. 
3. 20-30% of the time is actually designing and building something. The rest is trying to figure out why it's not working. If you can enjoy both, you will not notice how painful the learning process is. 

## Computer Engineering
1. Similarly to EE, most of the classes are generally foundational knowledge until you get into electives. Pick your electives carefully and try to pick ones you will love and not just something you think will be easy. 
2. 50/50 split on the hardware and software. You will also take classes from the Computer Science Department. 
3. Do not focus 100% on the Project Lab classes. It is the biggest and most addictive time sink in the curriculum by far.

## Sourcing Information
Information given from several different peers along with my own notes/hw/exams/projects while at the institution. Some of it may be outdated or only partially correct (hw, projects, exams, etc), so use as a guide only.
